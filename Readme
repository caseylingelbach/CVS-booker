hello!

I hope this works! I don't know how github works

1. Change "directory" to wherever your Excel file is located.
2. input file is name of file
3. find your ad-block extension (whatever you normally use) - chrome - extensions - details. Get the name of it and the path, put that folder in the second options.add_argument line
      #CVS gives a survey pop up otherwise I think
4. Download Chromedriver
5. Point the driver = webdriver.Chrome to it

You should be good to run?
